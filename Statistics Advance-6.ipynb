    "1. **Independence of Observations**: The samples must be independent of each other.\n",
    "   - *Violation*: If the data points within a sample are not independent, such as repeated measures on the same subjects without accounting for the correlation.\n",
    "2. **Normality**: The distribution of the residuals (errors) should be approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "   - *Violation*: If the residuals show a significant departure from normality, such as being heavily skewed or having outliers.\n",
    "3. **Homogeneity of Variances (Homoscedasticity)**: The variances across the groups should be equal.\n",
    "   - *Violation*: If one group has a much larger variance than the others, it could affect the ANOVA results.\n"
